/**
 * **Agent keepalive**: decides when the editor must not pause in the background.
 *
 * The editor pauses its play loop, viewport loop and file polling while the tab is hidden or
 * unfocused, to save a laptop's battery. In the external-agent pipeline the tab is in the
 * background almost all the time while the agent works (`pix3 mcp --workspace` → `pix3 serve` →
 * this window), and the agent must never wait for such a pause. So while an agent is involved the
 * pauses are off:
 *
 *   keepalive = setting on AND (
 *       the in-editor agent is running (including provider waits)
 *    OR
 *       presence attached               — the server's `agent-presence` (MCP heartbeats), also
 *                                         {@link PRESENCE_STALE_MS} after the socket dropped
 *    OR a call is in flight, or the last one finished < {@link RECENT_CALL_MS} ago
 *    OR play was started through the agent channel and is still running
 *    OR the events socket is reconnecting and keepalive was on when it dropped — for
 *                                         {@link RECONNECT_KEEPALIVE_MS} at most )
 *
 * The last row exists for the pipeline's most common drop, a restart of `pix3 serve`: presence
 * can only be learned over the socket, so while it is down an agent looks absent, and the
 * recent-call window can run out mid-reconnect. Keepalive then falls off, the reconnect timers go
 * back to throttled main-thread timers (a minute apart under Chrome's intensive throttling), and a
 * hidden tab takes minutes to come back to an agent that is waiting for it.
 *
 * The result goes to `appState.project.coauthoring.agentKeepalive` (status-bar pill) and to
 * `page-activity`'s {@link setEditorKeepAlive}, which every battery gate reads
 * (`isEditorActive`, `BackgroundTicker`, `keepaliveTimer`). With no agent involved it stays false
 * and the editor behaves exactly as before. The setting is "Keep the editor running while an agent
 * is connected" (Settings → General, `appState.ui.keepEditorRunningForAgent`, default on).
