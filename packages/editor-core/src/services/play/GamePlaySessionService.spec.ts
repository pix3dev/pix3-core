/**
 * The pause decision, and only it (§ "focus-pause rule"). Two independent inputs
 * can hold the running game — the editor's focus rule and an explicit host
 * request — and the bug this file exists for was that only the first one was
 * remembered: `handleFocusPause` re-derives the whole decision on every focus
 * event and on every suppression toggle, and its "should not pause" branch calls
 * `resume()`, so a `runner.pause()` from outside survived exactly until the next
 * event. `game_run` produced that event itself (dropping its focus-pause
 * suppression in the same `finally` that paused the game), so the promised
 * "left paused on the outcome frame" lasted microseconds.
 *
 * The service is driven directly rather than through DI: the decision needs a
 * runner, a host window and `appState`, and nothing else.
