/**
 * The FULL protocol of one `game_run`, written to a project file, so the tool
 * reply can stay compact and only point at it (§6 rule 3 of
 * `.plans/done/agent-gameplay-testing.md`: "survives compaction, does not burn
 * context" — the same argument `design/source/` makes for the GDD).
 *
 * The reply a run returns is a *summary* by construction: the timeline is deduped
 * and capped at 20 entries with at most 3 changed paths per frame, the monkey log
 * keeps a head and a tail, error messages are sliced to 120 characters, and the
 * per-frame node/property/axis readings the loop collected are not in it at all.
 * Every one of those caps exists so a run does not eat the model's context — and
 * every one of them destroys the evidence a second look would need. This module
 * is where the destroyed half goes.
 *
 * ## Why the file name looks like that
 *
 * `NNNN-<subject>-<verdict>[-f<frame>].json` — `0007-monkey-fail-f142.json`. The
 * name has to answer "which run was this and how did it end" from an `fs_list`
 * alone; a name that does not (a timestamp, a uuid, `report.json`) costs the agent
 * one `fs_read` per stored report just to find the one it wants, which is the
 * context spend this whole feature exists to avoid. The counter is derived from
 * the directory rather than from a clock, so the names sort chronologically
 * without a clock in them, and the wall clock lives inside the file as
 * `startedAt`. The listing that yields the counter is the same listing rotation
 * needs, so it costs nothing extra.
 *
 * ## Why the JSON is pretty-printed
 *
 * `fs_read` pages by LINES. A one-line JSON blob can therefore only ever be read
 * whole, which is exactly the failure this feature is trying to prevent — so the
 * document is written with two-space indentation on purpose, and `contains` tells
 * the reader to slice it with `{offset, limit}`.
