/**
 * `batch` — several tool calls issued as one, expanded by the chat loop.
 *
 * The measured shape of a turn (`.plans/agent-one-shot-generation.md`) is one tool call per model
 * round trip: `{0:1, 1:54}` before the P0 work and `{0:1, 1:60}` after it, and a direct probe of the
 * bridge lane showed the model will not emit several `tool_use` blocks even when told to. So the
 * batching has to come from a tool the model calls deliberately, not from hoping it batches.
 *
 * **Why the chat loop expands it instead of a registry handler.** Declared as an ordinary tool,
 * `batch` would walk past every scar in the loop at once: the loop-breaker's signature would become
 * `batch:{the whole JSON}` (a repeated inner call invisible), `tuningKnobSignature` would return
 * null (re-tuning one knob would stop counting), `isGameLogicMutation('batch')` would be false (the
 * verify-gate bypassed), and `VISUAL_TOOLS` would not see the nested names (the Flow screenshot
 * refusal bypassed the same way). Each of those counters exists because a real run needed it. So the
 * spec is declared in the registry — it has to reach `specs()` and the cacheable prefix — but its
 * handler throws, and the loop expands the call into virtual inner calls that each go through the
 * same per-call block. One `tool-result` goes back into history, so `tool_use`/`tool_result` pairing
 * is untouched for every provider.

 * their results?** If yes, they are one batch — reading the results afterwards is fine and normal.
 * If the answer to call 1 is what picks call 2, they are separate.
 *
 * That test replaced "a step whose result you must read does not go in a batch", which was measured
 * to be exactly backwards for the most common case: an agent that already knew it wanted four
 * specific files read them one per round trip, because a read is by definition a step whose result
 * you read. Four known paths are four independent decisions already made — one batch.
 *
 * - `ask_user` ends the turn legitimately — inside a batch there is no turn left to end.
 * - `ask_advisor` is a second model call; its answer exists to be read.
 * - `viewport_screenshot` / `analyze_image` produce pictures, and nothing inside a batch can look at
 *   them.
 * - every `generate_*` spends 10–60 s of network, and eval S2 established that the CONTENT of what
 *   comes back has to be judged by the model, not assumed.
 * - `batch` itself: nesting would multiply the budget and make the step numbering meaningless.
