/**
 * `game_run` — drive the running game frame by frame and stop on the first
 * outcome (§5.2 of `.plans/done/agent-gameplay-testing.md`). Phase 2: the vertical
 * slice. The point is the *loop* — baseline, per-frame predicates, early exit,
 * pause on outcome, report — not a full predicate vocabulary (that is phase 6).
 *
 * Why frame-stepping rather than "wait 3 s and look": the loop owns the clock, so
 * an event is caught in the frame it happens (not in a 100 ms sample that may
 * straddle it), a win on the second second does not cost fifteen, and the whole
 * run works in a background tab, where rAF is throttled to a crawl.
 *
 * ## Time-mode discipline
 *
 * The run switches the runner to `'manual'` and **always restores the previous
 * mode**, even on an error path. Leaving `'manual'` behind would be the worst
 * kind of leak: `manual` schedules no animation frame, so the next `play_resume`
 * (or a human pressing Play) produces a game that is running, unpaused, and
 * completely frozen — indistinguishable from a hang caused by the code under
 * test. The *pause* is a different matter and is kept (`pauseOnOutcome`): it is
 * what makes the outcome frame inspectable, and it is undone by
 * `game_time {paused: false}`, by `game_input` (which needs a running game), or
 * by play_restart. Either way the report states both facts under `time`.
 *
 * The pause is requested from the **host** (`deps.setHostPaused` →
 * `GamePlaySessionService.setPauseRequested`), not applied to the runner behind
 * its back. The editor decides the runner's pause state from its focus rule and
 * re-applies that decision on every focus event and suppression toggle — and this
 * very call drops its focus-pause suppression in its `finally` — so a bare
 * `runner.pause()` was undone milliseconds after the report claimed it held.
 * `leftPaused` is therefore read back from `runner.paused` at the end rather than
 * set from `pauseOnOutcome`: it is a fact about the game, not a restatement of
 * the request.
 *
 * ## Event predicates own a window, not a filter
 *
 * `command` and `signal` judge things that *happened* rather than values that
 * *are*, so the loop, not the predicate, decides what belongs to the run. The two
 * do it differently for a reason:
 *
 * - the **command journal** already exists and is shared with the whole scene, so
 *   the loop cuts it by position (`entries.length + dropped` is a monotone
 *   watermark) and reports what the ring buffer dropped inside the window;
 * - **signals** have no journal at all — `NodeBase.emit` walks its connections and
 *   returns — so the loop *creates* the record by subscribing at the start and
 *   disconnecting in its `finally`. Nothing outside the run is filtered out
 *   because nothing outside the run is ever heard.
 *
 * ## Input steps are not in this slice
 *
 * `GameInputService.run()` paces its steps with wall-clock `setTimeout`, and in
 * `'manual'` mode no tick happens while those timers run: a 500 ms key hold would
 * deliver keydown and keyup with **zero** frames in between, so the game would
 * never poll the key and every input-driven assertion would fail for a reason
 * that has nothing to do with the game. Frame-denominated input steps are a phase
 * 1/3 item on `GameInputService` itself. Until then a spec carrying `input` is
 * rejected with that explanation rather than run into a false negative.
