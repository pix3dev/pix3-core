/**
 * Monkey mode for `game_run` (§5.2 of `.plans/done/agent-gameplay-testing.md`).
 *
 * Random input under the harness's control, judged by invariants instead of by
 * an understanding of the game. It is the **zero test** for Flow's verify gate:
 * it cannot tell you the game is fun, or even that it is winnable, but it finds
 * the two failures that need no understanding at all — a crash, and a state the
 * game cannot leave.
 *
 * Everything here is pure logic over plain records: a seeded decision stream, a
 * catalogue of what the scene actually offers, and a stateful invariant monitor.
 * The loop (`GameTestService`) supplies the world and executes the actions; this
 * module never touches a runner, a node or a clock. That split is what lets a
 * spec prove determinism by replaying an inventory sequence, which is impossible
 * against a live scene.
 *
 * ## Three rules this module exists to enforce
 *
 * 1. **The seed is mandatory and reported.** A monkey finding that cannot be
 *    re-run is an anecdote. `parseMonkeySpec` refuses a run without one rather
 *    than inventing a random seed, because a harness-chosen seed is only
 *    reproducible if someone thought to write it down.
 * 2. **Actions come from the scene, not from imagination.** Candidates are the
 *    live interactive controls (as `game_controls` lists them) and the intents
 *    the game actually declares. A monkey that taps coordinates in an empty
 *    region proves nothing and, worse, looks like it is testing something.
 * 3. **A monkey with nothing to press is not a pass.** An empty inventory ends
 *    the run with a stated reason ({@link MONKEY_EMPTY_NOTE}); silence would
 *    otherwise read as "hammered the game for 600 frames, all clear".
