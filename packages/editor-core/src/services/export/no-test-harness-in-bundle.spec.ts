/**
 * The gameplay-testing harness must not be able to reach a shipped game (§5.3 of
 * `.plans/done/agent-gameplay-testing.md`, phase 8).
 *
 * The plan asked for "a spec proving there is no test code in the production bundle,
 * modelled on `strippable-runtime-modules.spec.ts`" — i.e. one that **recomputes the
 * facts from disk** rather than restating a decision. A declaration of intent would
 * pass forever; this fails the moment someone imports the harness from the runtime or
 * moves the policies into a directory the export collects.
 *
 * Two leak paths exist, and each gets its own recomputed check.
 *
 * 1. **Code.** A playable bundle's roots are the runtime package's own entry files
 *    plus the project's scripts. The runtime is a separate package with no `@/` alias,
 *    so the only way harness code could enter is a module under
 *    `packages/pix3-runtime/src` mentioning it — which is what the first test scans
 *    for, across the whole package rather than along one import chain, because a
 *    mention in a module a player *might* keep is already a mistake.
 *
 * 2. **Files.** Policies are TypeScript in the project's own tree, so the question is
 *    whether the export (and the editor's own script loader, which registers
 *    components into the live game) ever walks the directory they live in. It walks
 *    exactly `PROJECT_SCRIPT_DIRECTORIES`, read here out of `ProjectBuildService`, and
 *    the second test asserts every harness directory sits outside all of them. That is
 *    the invariant that makes a bot structurally incapable of registering itself as a
 *    game script component.
 *
 * What this spec deliberately does NOT claim: that a *user* cannot ship the files by
 * hand. `exportSettings.includeGlobs` is theirs, and a project that globs `design/**`
 * ships those bytes as assets. They are data either way — nothing loads or executes
 * them — and second-guessing an explicit include would be the wrong trade.
