/**
 * The file backend behind {@link TraceStore}: traces become real
 * `design/tests/*.trace.json` files in the open project, so a recording survives
 * a reload, is diffed and reviewed like any other project file, and can be
 * committed next to the code it guards.
 *
 * **Why `ProjectStorageService` and nothing lower.** It is the one seam over the
 * host's file API that maps project paths to wire paths *and* publishes the asset
 * mutations the Asset Browser listens to; writing below it would drop a written
 * trace out of the asset tree until a manual refresh.
 *
 * Three behaviours are load-bearing for the agent that calls this through
 * `game_trace`:
 *
 * - **A missing file is not an error.** `load()` returns `null`, which is what
 *   lets `GameTestService.replayTrace` answer "no trace stored at X, known
 *   traces: …" instead of surfacing a backend exception the model cannot act on.
 *   Only a *failed* read (permission revoked, network) throws.
 * - **A corrupt or foreign trace is a refusal, not a crash.** Bad JSON and a
 *   `formatVersion` from a newer build both come back from {@link parseTrace} as
 *   a sentence, which this store throws with the path attached; `replayTrace`
 *   turns it into `{ok:false, error}`. Replaying half-parsed garbage would
 *   produce a comparison verdict that means nothing, which is worse.
 * - **A missing `design/tests` directory lists as empty**, because a project
 *   that never recorded a trace is the normal case, not a broken one.
