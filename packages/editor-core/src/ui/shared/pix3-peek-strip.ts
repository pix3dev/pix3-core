/**
 * The Peek strip: one labelled chip per branch of the scene, plus the way back out.
 *
 * Every interaction choice here is a reaction to a shipped mistake in another tool:
 *
 * - **Chips carry labels.** Blender 2.7x had exactly this control as 20 unlabelled squares in the
 *   viewport header, and 2.80 removed it — nobody could tell which square was which, and it did not
 *   scale past its fixed count.
 * - **Click toggles, ⌥/Alt-click solos.** The other way round is what Blender shipped, and "I
 *   pressed 1 and everything disappeared" outlived five major versions before the binding was
 *   dropped. There is deliberately no unmodified hotkey at all.
 * - **A repeat ⌥-click returns the PREVIOUS set**, not "show all" — alt-clicking an eye in
 *   Photoshop, so a solo never silently discards the mask the author built.
 * - **The "N hidden · Show all" pill is always present while anything is hidden**, and is itself
 *   the exit. Illustrator's isolation-mode breadcrumb: an indicator alone still leaves people
 *   stuck, because it says *that* they are in a mode and not how to leave.
 * - **The strip never collapses into a closed menu.** Unity's Layers dropdown did, and hidden state
 *   behind a closed control is state people forget they set.
