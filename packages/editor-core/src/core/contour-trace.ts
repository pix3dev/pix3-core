/**
 * Alpha-mask → collision-polygon tracing (§9.12.2), used by the inspector's
 * "Trace from sprite" action. Restored from the 1.x Sprite Editor, which 2.x drops.
 *
 * Pure functions, no DOM, no canvas. The host
 * decodes the frame's pixels into a boolean mask (`readAlphaMask` in
 * `@/core/image-ops`) and hands it over, so the tracing math is
 * testable without mounting a component or decoding an image.
 *
 * **Coordinate contract.** Vertices are *pixel-corner* coordinates: pixel `(x, y)`
 * of the mask covers the square `[x, x+1] × [y, y+1]`, so a vertex ranges over
 * `0..width` / `0..height`, y down. That is exactly the **absolute frame-pixel**
 * space `AnimationFrame.collisionPolygon` stores and `restampFrameGeometry` maps —
 * a traced polygon can be written straight into a frame, and survives a later crop
 * or flip like a hand-drawn one.
 *
 * The pipeline is the classic two-stage one:
 *
 * 1. {@link traceMaskContour} — a marching-squares boundary walk that returns the
 *    outer outline of the largest opaque blob as a staircase of corner vertices.
 * 2. {@link simplifyPolygon} — Ramer–Douglas–Peucker with a tolerance in pixels,
 *    which turns that staircase into the handful of vertices a collider wants.
 *
 * {@link traceCollisionPolygon} is the entry point that runs both and enforces the
 * degenerate-case guarantees (empty mask, fully opaque mask, over-large tolerance).
