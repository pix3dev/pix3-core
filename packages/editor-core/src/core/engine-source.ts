/**
 * The engine's own source, as read-only ground truth.
 *
 * `@pix3/runtime`'s sources are already shipped into the browser — the code editor's TypeScript
 * worker type-checks project scripts against them — so nothing has to be fetched or installed to
 * read them. What was missing is a way for the **agent** to read them, and that gap is expensive in
 * a measurable way: an agent whose only account of the engine is prose documentation guesses field
 * names, and pays a compile round-trip per guess. Documentation is a summary; this is the contract.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices:
 *
 * - **Package-relative paths** (`@pix3/runtime/src/core/JuiceApi.ts`). That is the specifier a game
 *   script imports from plus the path inside the package, so a name found here can be imported
 *   without translation, and {@link resolveEnginePath} accepts the shorter forms an agent is likely
 *   to type instead of failing on them.
 * - **Read-only, and said out loud.** This is the engine that shipped inside the editor build, not
 *   a file the project can edit. An agent that tried to "fix" it would be writing into a bundle.

/**
 * A capability that lives OUTSIDE `@pix3/runtime/src` and therefore cannot be found by searching it.
 *
 * A search is only ground truth about the tree it searches. When the thing being looked for is
 * wired by the *editor* instead — shipped in the bundle and handed to project scripts through the
 * runtime import map — a silent result reads as "the engine does not have this", which is exactly
 * backwards. That misreading is not hypothetical: one session searched `rigidbody`, then `physics`,
 * then `rapier`, took the absence as an answer, and hand-wrote a 505-line box solver.
 *
 * So the search answers those queries with a note instead of leaving a silence to interpret. Two
 * details are deliberate: the note rides *alongside* whatever matches exist rather than replacing
 * them, and it fires on the **query**, not on the match count — the failure above did get hits
 * (comment mentions), so "zero matches" would have been too narrow a trigger.
 *
 * A note is a claim about the tree, so it goes stale the moment the tree grows. This one did: the
 * 2D solver later landed *inside* the package, and until it was rewritten the note still said
 * rigid-body physics was absent and sent 2D games to the query-only collision tier — steering
 * every top-down physics game (carrom, pool, air hockey, pinball) straight into the hand-written
 * solver it exists to prevent. The search is literal, so the natural-language query that finds
 * nothing is exactly the query that gets only this note: it has to be right on its own.
