description: Compact property reference for the Pix3 2D node types used by the recipes — Group2D, ColorRect2D, Sprite2D, Label2D, Button2D, Bar2D, CanvasLayer2D, PostProcess — plus the Node2D base properties, anchor layout and paint order; the full per-node reference (every 2D and 3D node) is reference.md beside it. Use when adding a node to a .pix3scene, choosing which node type to use, or checking a property name/type before writing it.

# 2D nodes — compact reference

Property names below are the exact YAML keys under `properties:`. A misspelled key is kept
silently and does nothing, so copy them from here or from an existing node in the project
(`pix3 check` flags unknown keys). Every node type, 2D and 3D, is in `reference.md` beside
this file — grep `### <NodeName>` there instead of reading it whole.

## Which node

| Need | Node |
| --- | --- |
| Scene root, a panel, a spawn band, any sized container | `Group2D` |
| Solid rectangle; the honest placeholder | `ColorRect2D` |
| An image (PNG/JPG/WebP) | `Sprite2D` |
| A nine-slice panel / tiled background | `TiledSprite2D` |
| Text | `Label2D` |
| Tappable button | `Button2D` |
| Health / progress bar | `Bar2D` |
| Fixed HUD layer that ignores the 2D camera and is never post-processed | `CanvasLayer2D` |
| Bloom / vignette | `PostProcess` (no transform; set `affect2D: true` in a 2D scene) |
| Bare transform, no size | `Node2D` |

Other 2D types exist (`AnimatedSprite2D`, `Slider2D`, `Checkbox2D`, `Joystick2D`,
`ScrollContainer2D`, `InventorySlot2D`, `Camera2D`, `SpineSkeleton2D`); do not guess their
keys — read their section in `reference.md` first. `Layout2D` is removed and fails the load.

## Node2D — every 2D node has these

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `transform` | block | — | `{ position: [x, y], scale: [sx, sy], rotation: degrees }` — centre of the node, Y up, positive rotation = counter-clockwise |
| `visible` | bool | true | On an overlay **instance**: editor-only hide (see pix3-scene-format) |
| `initiallyVisible` | bool | — | Applied when play mode starts; authored on an overlay file's root |
| `opacity` | number | 1 | 0..1, multiplies into children |
| `zIndex` | int | 0 | -4096..4096; higher draws on top; ties = tree order |
| `zAsRelative` | bool | true | Add to the parent's z instead of absolute |
| `blendMode` | enum | normal | `normal`, `additive` (glow/VFX), `multiply`, `subtract`; not inherited |
| `layout` | block | — | `{ enabled, horizontalAlign: left/center/right/stretch, verticalAlign: top/center/bottom/stretch }` |
| `flow` | block | — | `{ enabled, direction: vertical/horizontal, gap, paddingX, paddingY, align: start/center/end, autoSize }` |

Paint order = tree order (later sibling / deeper node on top) unless `zIndex` says otherwise.
Shader `effects` exist only on `Sprite2D`, `AnimatedSprite2D` and `Button2D`.

## Group2D

Sized container; draws nothing. Use it as the scene root (sized to `viewportBaseSize` from
`pix3project.yaml` — `width: 1080, height: 1920` in the recipes — `layout` stretch/stretch) and for any panel whose children anchor or flow against it.

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `width` | number | 100 |
| `height` | number | 100 |

## ColorRect2D

The only untextured 2D fill. Build the game from these first, swap to sprites later.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `width` | number | 100 | |
| `height` | number | 100 | |
| `color` | colour | "#ffffff" | Quoted hex. Alpha via `opacity`, not the colour |

## Sprite2D

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `texture` | texture | — | `{ type: 'texture', url: 'res://sprites/x.png' }` (a bare `texturePath` string is only read for compatibility) |
| `width` | number | texture width | Display size; the image is scaled to it (64 until the texture loads) |
| `height` | number | texture height | |
| `anchor` | vector2 | [0.5, 0.5] | Pivot the image is positioned around |
| `aspectRatioLocked` | bool | false | Keep the texture's aspect while resizing |
| `effects` | list | — | `[{ type: core:tint, params: { color: "#hex", amount: 1 } }]` — how a near-white placeholder gets its colour |

There is no tint property: colour a sprite with a `core:tint` effect. Recipe placeholders are
near-white `sprites/ph-*.png` + `effects: [{ type: core:tint, params: { color, amount: 1 } }]`.

### An SVG you write as a sprite

A `.svg` in `sprites/` works as a `Sprite2D` / `Button2D` texture in the editor, in play mode and
in the single-file export — **when a browser `<img>` would decode it**, because that is how every
texture loads. The browser rasterises it once, at its own `width`/`height`, and the GPU scales that
bitmap. So:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="128" height="128" viewBox="0 0 128 128">
  <circle cx="64" cy="64" r="56" fill="#ffcf33" stroke="#8a5a00" stroke-width="8"/>
</svg>
```

- `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` on the root — without it nothing renders.
- `width` and `height` in px **and** a matching `viewBox`. Without a size the browser invents a
  300x150 box (art letterboxed or cropped, the sprite auto-sizes to 300x150).
- Make `width`/`height` the size the node draws it at (the node's `width`/`height`), or larger —
  a 32px SVG drawn at 256px is a blurry bitmap, not crisp vectors.
- Self-contained: no `<image href="http…">`, no `<use href="other.svg#…">`, no CSS `url(file)`,
  no `@import`, no webfonts — none of them load when an SVG is an image (only `#id` and `data:`
  do). Text only with generic families (`font-family="sans-serif"`); better, draw shapes.

`pix3 validate` checks every `.svg` a scene references: `E_SVG_INVALID` (no `<svg>` root or no
xmlns), `E_SVG_NO_SIZE`, `W_SVG_VIEWBOX_ONLY`, `W_SVG_EXTERNAL_REF`.

## Label2D

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `label` | string | "" | The text; `\n` breaks lines. Never only emoji |
| `labelFontSize` | number | 16 | px |
| `labelColor` | colour | "#ffffff" | |
| `labelFontFamily` | string | Arial | A family the project ships in `fonts/`, else a system face |
| `labelFontWeight` | number | 400 | 400 / 700 / 900 … |
| `labelAlign` | enum | center | `left`, `center`, `right` |
| `labelVAlign` | enum | middle | `top`, `middle`, `bottom` |
| `width` / `height` | number | 0 | 0 = auto-size, no wrap. Set `width` to word-wrap |
| `glowColor` / `glowStrength` | colour / 0–4 | "#ffffff" / 0 | Canvas-drawn neon glow; 2–3 reads as neon |
| `outlineColor` / `outlineWidth` | colour / px | "#000000" / 0 | Contrast outline |
| `labelShadowColor`, `labelShadowOffsetX/Y`, `labelLetterSpacing`, `typewriterSpeed` | | | see `reference.md` |

Scripts: `label.setText('SCORE 5')`.

## Button2D

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `width` / `height` | number | 100 / 40 | |
| `label` | string | "" | Caption; `labelFontSize` (16), `labelColor` ("#ffffff"), `labelAlign` as on Label2D |
| `backgroundColor` | colour | "#4a4a4a" | Flat idle colour |
| `hoverColor` | colour | "#5a5a5a" | |
| `pressedColor` | colour | "#3a3a3a" | |
| `buttonAction` | string | "Submit" | Free identifier for scripts |
| `enabled` | bool | true | A disabled button takes no input |
| `textureNormal` / `textureHover` / `texturePressed` / `textureDisabled` | texture | — | Skin sprites; a set slot replaces the flat colour |
| `sliceBorderLeft/Right/Top/Bottom` | number | 0 | Nine-slice insets in source pixels |
| `effects` | list | — | Shader effects on the skin |

Signals: `pressed` (finger/button went down inside it), `released`, `click` (down **and** up
inside it — a completed tap; sliding off cancels it), `pointerdown`, `pointerup`. The recipes
wire `pressed` for an instant response; use `click` where an accidental touch must be
cancellable (menus, purchases). `button.connect('click', this, handler)`.

## Bar2D

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `width` / `height` | number | 150 / 20 | |
| `minValue` / `maxValue` / `value` | number | 0 / 100 / 100 | Fill = value within the range (clamped) |
| `barColor` | colour | "#ff4444" | Fill colour |
| `backBackgroundColor` | colour | "#333333" | Trough colour |
| `showBorder` / `borderColor` / `borderWidth` | bool / colour / px | true / "#000000" / 2 | The recipes set `showBorder: false` |
| `textureTrough` / `textureFill` | texture | — | Skin sprites |
| `sliceBorderLeft/Right/Top/Bottom` | number | 0 | Nine-slice insets of the skins |

Scripts: `bar.maxValue = n; bar.setValue(v)`.

## CanvasLayer2D

A HUD band: rendered after post-processing (never blooms) with a fixed camera. Same keys as
`Group2D` (`width`, `height`, transform, layout). Put score/time/lives/buttons under it.
Its ancestors' transform, opacity and visibility still apply.

## PostProcess

No transform — keys sit flat in `properties`. The first active one in the tree wins.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `affect2D` | bool | true | Apply to the 2D layer too |
| `bloomEnabled` / `bloomIntensity` / `bloomThreshold` | bool / number / number | true / 1 / 0.9 | Bloom lifts only what is already bright |
| `bloomSmoothing` / `bloomRadius` | number | | |
| `vignetteEnabled` / `vignetteOffset` / `vignetteDarkness` | bool / number / number | | |
| `chromaticAberrationEnabled` / `chromaticAberrationOffset` | bool / number | | |

Brighten the colour or lower `bloomThreshold` rather than raising `bloomIntensity`. The
opposite for a pastel or light look: a pale ground sits above a low threshold and the whole
screen blooms — **raise** `bloomThreshold` (0.85–0.95) so only the accents glow.

## Example — a new HUD label anchored top-right

```yaml
- id: combo-label
  type: Label2D
  name: Combo Label
  properties:
    label: ""
    labelFontSize: 40
    labelColor: "#f5ae39"
    labelAlign: right
    transform:
      position: [340, 790]
      scale: [1, 1]
      rotation: 0
    layout:
      enabled: true
      horizontalAlign: right
      verticalAlign: top
  children: []
```

## Known gaps

- On a **cloud** project (opened from the Pix3 server, not a folder or `pix3 serve`) an `.svg`
  sprite renders on first load and then goes blank: the local cache hands SVGs back as
  `text/plain`, which no browser decodes as an image. Folder and `pix3 serve` projects are fine;
  on cloud, use a PNG.
