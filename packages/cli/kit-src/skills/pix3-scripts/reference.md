# Script API reference

Generated from the engine's own documentation and code. Grep a heading instead of reading it
whole. Tool names the in-editor agent uses appear in places: `add_component` /
`set_component_property` = edit the scene YAML's `components:`; `list_component_types` = the
"`core:` components" section at the end of this file; `engine_search` / `engine_read` do not
exist for you — the runtime's declarations are in `.pix3/types/@pix3/runtime/` (or in
`node_modules/@pix3/runtime` when the project has its own `tsconfig.json`). Source paths quoted here (`src/…`, `packages/…`) are files of the Pix3 engine repository, not of this project.

## Capability catalog — nodes

## Capability catalog — `core:*` behaviours

## `core:` components — every config key

Read from the runtime's component registry for this CLI's version: the keys a `config:` block
may carry, their type, the default a fresh component has, and the inspector's range/options.
