How to check that what you built actually runs, and how to fix it when it doesn't. Never
declare a feature done without running it.

## The loop

0. **Edit with `str_replace`, not a full `fs_write`.** To change existing code, replace the exact
   lines you mean to change with `str_replace` (fails loudly if the anchor isn't unique). A full
   `fs_write` rewrite risks silently dropping or reverting the rest of the file — reserve it for
   creating a file. Never re-emit a whole script to flip one sign or constant.
1. **Read the `verify` block the write gave you.** A write under `scripts/` comes back having
   already been built, registered and type-checked: `verify.compile.ok === false` means the bundle
   broke (`error`/`file`/`line`) or `errorCount` type errors came back in `diagnostics` (read-only
   `position`/`rotation`/`scale`, wrong argument types, bad imports). Fix those files — the next
   write re-checks them. Call `compile_scripts` yourself only when a write came back WITHOUT a
   `verify` block. **Never call `check_scripts` after either** — the same diagnostics are already
   there. `verify.unverified` says what the check did not cover; that part is step 2's job.
2. **Run it**: `play_start`, then `play_status`. Give it a moment, then `read_errors` (runtime
   errors: thrown exceptions, rejections) and `read_logs` (log output). A clean run has no
   captured errors.
2b. **Prove the behaviour** — a clean compile is NOT proof the change works. Drive it with
   `game_input` (or `game_observe` + `sampleMs` for self-movers), then **read `verdict` first** —
   it fuses every signal into one line. `moved:false` does NOT mean the game is dead: a spawner,
   projectile pool, or HUD reacts without its container ever moving. Anything that plays out over
   time — a wave clearing, a death, a score climbing — is judged by `game_run` with an explicit
   success condition, not by watching a window and deciding (see "Time and frames").
   - **Movers** (car, player): `{steps:[{type:'key',code:'KeyW',ms:800}],expect:{PlayerCar:'forward'}}`
     → read `observed.PlayerCar.directionOk`. Do NOT trust `moved:true` alone — a car driving
     sideways/backwards is still `moved:true`; check `alignForward` (≈1 forward, ≈0 sideways, ≈−1 back).
   - **Spawners / shooters / pools / HUD** (a container that fires or holds a score, e.g.
     `Cannonballs`): its position never changes, so `moved:false` is normal and meaningless.
     Watch it and assert `expect:{Cannonballs:'activity'}`, then read `observed.Cannonballs.activity`:
     `spawned`/`removed` children, `visibleChildPeak` (pools recycle ammo by toggling visibility —
     count of shots in flight, not position), `maxChildDistance` (a projectile flew while the
     spawner sat at 0,0). Transients that spawn AND die inside the window are caught by the window
     recorder — endpoints alone would miss them.
   - **Transient / interaction-gated visual effects** (hover states, hover-scale, press
     effects, `core:PunchScale`, `core:PopIn`, fades, flashes, shakes): verify by STATE, never
     by a separate screenshot. A `viewport_screenshot` taken after `game_input` returns ALWAYS
     shows the resting state — the gesture ended and the effect lerped back before the
     screenshot call even started. Reshooting will not fix this; it is structural.
     Instead, trigger and measure in ONE `game_input` call:
     `{steps:[{type:'hover',target:'Play Button',ms:900}],expect:{'Play Button':'activity'}}`
     → read `observed['Play Button'].scaleDelta.ratio` (endpoint, e.g. ≈1.08 for a hover-scale)
     and `activity.maxScaleDelta` / `activity.opacityRange` (window peaks — these catch a
     PunchScale/PopIn/flash that fired AND settled back inside the window). For press effects
     use a `tap` with a generous `holdMs` and read the same fields. Hover persists after the
     call (the synthetic pointer stays put), so to prove the return-to-rest half, hover away —
     `{type:'hover',x:<empty area>,y:<empty area>}` — and check scale returns to base.
     Screenshots are for STATIC properties only: layout, colors, placement.
   - **Game state**: when a GameDebugProvider is registered the result carries `game.changed`
     (ammo/score/wave diff) — often the clearest proof of all. If your game has none, register one
     (see the game-prototype skill) so gameplay is legible to state, not screenshots.
3. **Look at it** (optional but valuable): `viewport_screenshot` — while the game is running it
   captures the RUNNING GAME, otherwise the edit-mode viewport (check `view` in the result;
   `source:"game"|"editor"` forces one). In edit mode the user's camera may be zoomed/scrolled
   anywhere, so pass `frame:"all"` to fit the whole scene, `frame:"selection"`, or `nodeId` to
   zoom onto one node (add `isolate:true` when other content covers it); framing is temporary and
   never moves the user's camera. If your model can't see images, use `analyze_image` with
   `source:"viewport"` (same auto-routing) — ask e.g. "are the menu buttons visible and inside
   the screen?".
   Do NOT use screenshots to verify transient/hover/press effects — see 2b: by the time a
   separate screenshot runs, the effect is back at rest, and reshooting in a loop proves
   nothing. (Exception: a hover state deliberately left active by the last `hover` step is
   still on screen and MAY be screenshotted for a visual once the state delta already passed.)
4. **Fix** the first error, then repeat. You do NOT have to stop the game to edit: write the fix
   (its result carries the `verify` block — read it), then `play_restart` — one call picks up the
   fresh build. Reach for `play_stop` only in the rare case where something must be edited with
   nothing ticking.
5. **Leave the game the way the mode expects.**
   - **Studio**: the user did not ask for a running game, so once you have the verification you
     need (or have finished iterating), `play_stop`. A live session keeps ticking in the background
     (spawners, physics, audio, rAF) and burns CPU/GPU indefinitely. Confirm `play_status` reports
     it stopped before you report back.
   - **Flow**: the stage plays continuously next to the chat. You did not start it and you must not
     stop it — leave it running (`flow-increment` §8). A stopped stage is a black screen for the
     user.

## Input channels: what proves what

Three ways to reach a control, and they form a ladder — each rung skips exactly what the rung
below it proves:

| Channel | How you address it | Proves | Skips |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **physical** | pixels, a real pointer: `game_input` `tap`/`hover`/`drag`/`key` | the control is reachable — on screen, right size — and the gesture itself | — |
| **semantic** | the control by name: a `game_input` `{type:'invoke',…}` step, names from `game_controls` | everything AFTER "the point is inside the control": `enabled`, the ancestor-scroll gate, the skin state machine, signal order, the game logic listening on them | whether a finger could land on it — the pointer is synthesized from the control's own transform |
| **command** | the intent: the command a handler dispatches (`start-game`, `restart`, `settings.toggle-music`) | the game logic behind the intent | whether the control is wired to that command |

**Rule: make the FIRST contact with a control a physical `tap` — that is what flips its `reach` to
`reachable` — then drive it with `invoke` for everything after.** One physical proof per control
instead of a round of coordinate guesses every iteration; skipping it is how a button nobody can
hit passes every test.

Three things that bite:

- **Overlap is invisible.** `game_controls` has no "covered by another control" status and cannot
  grow one: the engine runs no global picking pass, every control polls the pointer itself, so a
  tap where two controls overlap fires BOTH. The missing status is not evidence there is no
  overlap — if two controls share screen space, that is a bug only you will find.
- **Reach proof is session memory, not truth.** It survives the control moving, being re-laid-out,
  or the viewport changing, so a `reachable` earned before a layout change can be a lie. Re-tap
  physically after you move a control or rebuild the screen it lives on.
- **Match the predicate to the widget** with `game_run`'s `command`/`signal` predicates: a
  **button's** binding is proven by `command(…)` — its handler dispatches one — while a **state
  control's** (checkbox, inventory slot) is proven by `signal('toggled')`, because there the
  command flips the control and the effect hangs off the control's own signal.

## Time and frames

- **Count in `frames`, not `ms`, whenever what matters is a number of ticks** — input holds and the
  `game_observe` window both take either. `ms:800` is 800 ms of wall clock and however many polls
  the frame rate happened to deliver; `frames:8` is the same test on a slow machine and a fast one.
  Keep `ms` only for things genuinely about wall time.
- **`game_run` judges, `game_observe` samples.** `game_observe` watches a window and hands you what
  it saw; `game_run` checks your condition on EVERY frame and stops on the first one that decides —
  an event lasting one frame is caught instead of straddled, and a win in the second second costs
  two seconds, not fifteen. Use `game_run` whenever you can state the success condition.
- **Assert the change, not the value.** A predicate already true at frame 0 ends the run with
  `PRECONDITION ALREADY MET` and proves nothing — assert `gameStateChanged` on `score`, not
  `gameState score gte 0`. A `fail` beats an `until` on the same frame, deliberately.
- **`game_run` sends no input.** Send it with `game_input` (realtime), then call `game_run` with
  only `until`/`fail` to judge what follows. It leaves the game paused on the outcome frame for
  `game_observe` and restores the time mode itself.
- **A `game_time` mode you forgot to set back looks exactly like a hung game** — `manual` most of
  all. Return to `realtime` when done; the config is replaced whole, so `mode` goes in every call.

## Design the game intent-first

Every UI reaction gets a named intent method; the handler only calls it.

```ts
onStart(): void {
  this.connectButton(String(this.config.playButton ?? ''), () => this.startGame());
}

private startGame(): void {
  /* the whole reaction lives here */
}
```

Name the method after what the player means — `startGame()`, `openMenu()`, `closeWindow()`,
`restart()`, `ctaClick()`, `toggleMusic()` — never after the widget. The templates already do this
and register each intent as a command (`start-game`, `open-settings`, `restart`, `cta-click`,
`settings.toggle-music`); copy that shape instead of inlining logic into a handler. An intent with
a name is addressable by all three channels — a handler with logic inlined is reachable only by
pixels.

## GameDebugProvider is the cheapest check

Register one per game: `registerGameDebug({ name, snapshot })`, where `snapshot()` returns the
fields that actually decide a run — score, lives, ammo, wave, phase. Every `game_input` /
`game_observe` result then carries `game.changed`, so "does shooting work" is a state diff instead
of a picture (step 2b).

The templates register it in `GameFlow` / `GameRules`. **When you add a mechanic, add its field to
the snapshot** — state the provider doesn't mention is state nothing can verify, and the check
falls back to screenshots that prove nothing.

## design/tests/ — what the harness keeps in the project

Everything here survives context compaction and is reviewed like code. That is the point: a
scenario you got right once should never be re-derived.

- `routines/<name>.json` — one replayable scenario, run with `game_run {routine:'<name>', args}`:
  `name`, `description` (a single line — it is the ONLY part that reaches your context), `scope`
  (scene or tag), optional `params`, `uses` (the nodes it touches), `steps`, `expect`. Steps are the
  `game_input` vocabulary plus `{type:'command', name}`; `expect` is the same predicate objects as
  `until`, ANDed and judged once after the last step. **A routine with no `expect` is a macro, not a
  test**, and the verdict says so. Keep `uses` honest: a renamed node answers `ROUTINE STALE` with
  the name before anything runs, which is a one-line diagnosis instead of a scenario that failed
  halfway through.
- `bots/<name>.ts` — a policy that plays the game; see below.
- `<name>.trace.json` — a recorded input trace (`game_trace`), replayed to compare outcomes between
  two increments of your own work.
- `reports/NNNN-*.json` — the full protocol of each run. Slice it with `fs_read {offset, limit}`;
  the reply is a summary of it.
- `reachability.json` — the journal of controls proven reachable by a real physical tap. Written by
  the harness; never hand-write entries, and expect a proof to burn when the control moves.

## Bot policies: when the decisions come faster than a tool call

A routine replays a fixed script. A **policy** decides every tick — which is what gameplay like
surviving a runner, dodging, or chasing needs, and what a tool call per decision cannot deliver.

Write `design/tests/bots/<name>.ts` and run it with
`game_run {bot: {name: '<name>'}, maxFrames: 1800}`:

```ts
export default {
  name: 'survive-30s',
  tick(bot) {
    const hero = bot.nodes('Hero')[0];
    if (!hero) return bot.done(false, 'the hero left the scene');
    const rock = bot.nearest('Rock2D', hero.worldPosition);
    bot.axis('Horizontal', rock && rock.node.worldPosition.x > hero.worldPosition.x ? -1 : 1);
    if (bot.frame >= 1800) bot.done(true, 'survived 30s at 60fps');
  },
};
```

The API is ~10 methods: sensors `nodes(query)` / `nearest(type, from)` / `raycast(from, dir)` /
`gameState()`, actuators `press(action, frames?)` / `release(action)` / `tap(target)` /
`axis(name, value)` / `moveTo(point)`, protocol `log(event)` / `done(pass, reason)`, plus
`bot.frame`. On the first successful compile the editor writes `pix3-test-bot.d.ts` next to your
policy, so `bot.` completes in the code view.

Five things decide whether a policy works:

- **Observe frame N, act for frame N+1.** `tick` runs after the game's tick and every actuator lands
  on the next one. A policy that expects its own press to be visible in the same tick reads as a game
  that ignores input.
- **`channel` defaults to `physical-input`** — real pointer and key events, the whole player path,
  and the only setting under which the run proves an input binding. `axis()` there deflects the live
  on-screen joystick that writes the axis, and **refuses by name** when no control does (the runtime
  has no keyboard-to-axis binding: a key raises `Key_<code>` as a *button*). `direct-action` sets
  axes and calls interactions directly: use it to test logic when the binding is already proven, and
  never to close an input check — the report and the verdict both say it proves nothing.
- **Read `verdict` first.** `BOT PASS` / `BOT FAIL` carry your own `reason`, the frame and the
  channel. `BOT ERROR` means the *policy* threw — the fault is in your file, nothing is claimed about
  the game, and it is deliberately **not** counted in `newErrors`, so a `fail: [{kind:'newErrors'}]`
  crash net cannot mistake your typo for a game crash (it is logged as a warning instead).
  `BOT NOTHING DRIVEN` means no actuator was ever delivered, so the run is not a pass even if the
  policy claimed one; the refusals in `bot.log` say what could not be reached. A `done(false)` still
  reads as `BOT FAIL` even when nothing was driven — "I could not play" is a finding.
- **`done(pass, reason)` is the finding.** Write the reason for a reader who has not seen the run:
  "hero died: lives 0 at the third gap", not "failed". Call it from `tick`, never from `end` — by
  then the run is over and the verdict decided nothing.
- **`until`/`fail` still apply** as the budget and the crash net. Omit `until` and it becomes
  `maxFrames`; add `fail: [{kind:'newErrors'}]` and a script throwing beats any verdict the policy
  reaches on that frame.

Three canonical policies to copy instead of inventing:

```ts
// chase — close the distance to the nearest target.
export default {
  name: 'chase',
  tick(bot) {
    const me = bot.nodes('Hero')[0];
    const target = me && bot.nearest('Coin2D', me.worldPosition);
    if (!me || !target) return;
    bot.axis('Horizontal', Math.sign(target.node.worldPosition.x - me.worldPosition.x));
    bot.axis('Vertical', Math.sign(target.node.worldPosition.y - me.worldPosition.y));
    if (target.distance < 8) bot.log(`reached ${target.node.name} at frame ${bot.frame}`);
  },
};
```

```ts
// avoid — steer away from whatever is closest, and report a hit as the finding.
export default {
  name: 'avoid',
  tick(bot) {
    const me = bot.nodes('Hero')[0];
    if (!me) return bot.done(false, `the hero is gone at frame ${bot.frame}`);
    const threat = bot.nearest('Rock2D', me.worldPosition);
    if (!threat) return bot.axis('Horizontal', 0);
    if (threat.distance < 6) return bot.done(false, `hit ${threat.node.name} at frame ${bot.frame}`);
    bot.axis('Horizontal', -Math.sign(threat.node.worldPosition.x - me.worldPosition.x));
  },
};
```

```ts
// pressWhen — hold an action while a condition holds. The shape for "jump over the gap".
export default {
  name: 'press-when',
  tick(bot) {
    const state = bot.gameState();
    const shouldHold = Boolean(state && state.onGround === false ? false : state?.gapAhead);
    if (shouldHold) bot.press('Key_Space', 6);
    else bot.release('Key_Space');
  },
};
```

Sensor cost is worth knowing: `nodes`/`nearest` walk the live tree, `raycast` builds a world-space
bounding box per node and is the most expensive call available — reach for it when you need "is
something in the way", not every tick. And `raycast` tests bounding boxes, not geometry and not
colliders, which is what makes it mean the same thing in 2D and 3D.

One gap to know about: **a bot's physical tap does not flip a control's `reach` to `reachable`** the
way a `game_input` tap does, even though it dispatches the same real pointer. So a bot run does not
accrue the "one physical proof per control" the ladder above is built on — tap the control once with
`game_input` if you need that proof recorded.

## Common runtime problems and fixes

- **A black or empty 3D scene** — read `sceneIssues` in the `scene_tree` / `game_observe` result
  before anything else. `lit-material-no-light` means the meshes have no light and draw black;
  `no-camera-3d` means nothing 3D is drawn at all; `inert-nodes` means a node's `type` is not a
  real node type (it loaded as a placeholder that does nothing — the message names the correct
  spelling). Never settle this with a viewport screenshot: the editor lights the scene with
  fallback lights the running game does not have, and says so via `editorFallbackLighting`.
  **When all three codes come up clean and the screen is still the bare clear colour, the cause is
  at runtime, not in the file.** Ask `play_status`: it reports `render` (draw calls / triangles of
  the last frame) and `visible3D` (the active camera, how many 3D meshes exist, and how many are
  inside its frustum). Meshes present with `inFrustum: 0` means **the camera is not looking at the
  scene** — not a light, not a material, and no screenshot can tell you that. Then read the
  camera's LIVE orientation with `game_observe` and look at `forward` (its world-space facing
  vector), NOT the authored rotation from `node_inspect`: a script that aims the camera at runtime
  makes the two disagree, and that disagreement IS the bug. `rotationZ` alone cannot show a 3D
  mis-aim — a camera turned 180° off the content has every node present, `visible: true`,
  positioned and lit, and still draws zero objects.
- **"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'scene'/'input')"** — a script used
  `this.scene` / `this.input` before the scene was ready, or in an editor preview. Guard with
  `if (!this.scene) return;` at the top of `onUpdate`.
- **A component threw and got auto-disabled** — the engine disables a component that throws in
  `onStart`/`onUpdate` and logs it. `read_errors` shows the throw; fix the script, re-enable
  via `set_component_property` `enabled: true` (or re-add), and replay.
- **"Nothing happened" after input** — before concluding the input was dead, re-read the
  `verdict` and `activity`/`game.changed` in the result. The classic false negative: you tapped
  fire, watched the shot *container* (which never moves), saw `moved:false`, and assumed the tap
  missed — but `activity.visibleChildPeak`/`spawned` or `game.changed` shows the shots really
  fired. Only if `verdict` says NO ACTIVITY is the input actually not reaching gameplay.
- **Genuinely dead input** — `read_errors` first: a component that threw was auto-disabled and
  will not tick again until fixed and re-enabled. Then check the script is actually attached
  (`node_inspect` the node → look at `components`) and `enabled`. For taps use
  `this.input?.pointerEvents.some(e => e.type === 'down')`. For keyboard, match on `event.code`
  (`'KeyW'`, `'ArrowUp'`) — `event.key` is case-sensitive (`'ArrowUp'`, never `'arrowup'`).
- **`Cannot assign to read only property 'position'/'rotation'`** — three.js transforms are
  read-only references; use `node.position.set(x, y, z)` / `node.rotation.z = radians`. Never
  hide this with `as any` — that's what the type-check inside `compile_scripts` exists to catch.
- **Moves, but in the WRONG direction (sideways / backwards / turns the wrong way)** — this is a
  math bug, not a "does it move" bug, and blind sign-flipping never converges. Verify with
  `game_input`/`game_observe` and read `alignForward`/`alignRight`, don't guess. `rotation.z`
  rotates the node's local +Y ("nose") to world `(-sin θ, cos θ)` and local +X to `(cos θ, sin θ)`,
  counter-clockwise (with world +Y up). So a car whose nose is +Y moves forward with
  `vx = -Math.sin(rot.z)*speed`, `vy = Math.cos(rot.z)*speed`; an AI aiming its nose along a
  velocity `(dx, dy)` sets `rotation.z = Math.atan2(-dx, dy)`. Using `+sin` (or `atan2(dx, dy)`)
  mirrors X → the body slides sideways the moment it turns.
- **A button does nothing** — split the two failures with `game_controls` first: a `reach` other
  than `reachable`/`in-frame-unproven` or `enabled:false` means no tap can land, and the script is
  innocent. If it lists clean, `invoke` it — the signals now definitely fired, so a still-dead game
  is a binding bug: buttons emit `pressed`/`released`/`click`, something must
  `node.connect('pressed', target, handler)`, and the flow script must be attached to a node that
  exists and name the right node ids.
- **A hover/press/juice effect "doesn't work" but screenshots look normal** — screenshots taken
  after `game_input` always show the resting state (transient effects reset when the gesture
  ends). Verify with a state delta instead: `hover` (or `tap` with `holdMs`) the node and read
  `scaleDelta`/`scaled`/`opacityDelta` + `activity.maxScaleDelta`/`activity.opacityRange` in the
  result. If those are flat, the effect really didn't fire — check the script is attached and
  reads `isHovering`/signals, and `read_errors` for an auto-disabled component.
- **Sprite looks wrong** (semi-transparent, box background, huge) — an art problem, not code.
  Reprocess the texture with `process_asset` (preset `sprite`). See the `asset-generation` skill.
- **Scene didn't update after editing a `.pix3scene` file** — the editor watches the active
  scene file and reloads automatically (there is no `scene.reload` command); confirm with
  `scene_tree`. Remember a scene `fs_write` replaces the scene wholesale — components added
  earlier via `add_component` are lost unless they are in the YAML.

## When you're stuck

- Re-read the failing script with `fs_read` — don't guess its contents.
- `read_logs` shows your own `console.log` output from scripts; add logging to narrow it down.
- **Count your fix attempts, and call the advisor at two.** `ask_advisor` (when it is available)
  is not a last resort — the trigger is countable: two attempts that did not change the symptom,
  or one symptom you still cannot explain after reading the code that should explain it. Put the
  exact error text, the failing script's source, and what you already tried into `context`, apply
  its fix, then re-run this loop. A measured session had an advisor configured, went ~20 steps
  stuck without ever calling it, and ended with the bug unresolved: an advisor you never ask is
  the most expensive tool in the box.
- Report the exact error text to the user with the file/line if you can't resolve it (advisor
  included) — and say what you tried.
